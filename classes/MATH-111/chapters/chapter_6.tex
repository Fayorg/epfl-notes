\chapter{Orthogonality and the least squares method}
Let's consider the following system of linear equations:
\[
    A \vec{x} = \vec{b}
\]
with $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, $\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. If this system has no solution, there might be $\vec{x}$ such that:
\[
    A \vec{x} \approx \vec{b}
\]
Thus new concepts are needed to find an approximate solution.
